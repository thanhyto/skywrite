### SkyWrite
SkyWrite is a project made to help people visually see 2D embeddings of sentences and how they interact with each other in the 2D embedding space. 
Our project connects sentences via drawn out lines to create shapes. The project also uses a library called Vec2Text in order to combine embeddings and sentences together. 

A video explaining our project can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEh6nYLNnxo
